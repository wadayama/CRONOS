# Project Concept: Digital Cybernetics and Post-Shannon Communication

## Overview

Cybernetics, founded by Norbert Wiener, is an interdisciplinary field that explores the common mechanisms by which organisms and machines exchange information to achieve goals, utilizing negative feedback for self-regulation. **Digital Cybernetics Systems**, based on advanced digital technologies (IoT, AI, etc.), provide an integrated framework for designing and implementing system autonomy, adaptability, and robustness using analogies from biological nervous systems.

A Digital Cybernetics System is a large-scale AI agent system with inputs from the real world through sensors and outputs via actuators or effectors that influence the environment. It can be viewed as an extension of the digital twin concept based on world models.

## Vision: The Need for Post-Shannon Communication

Systems that autonomously interact closely with their environment through AI-embedded feedback loops to perform tasks such as autonomous environmental control and anomaly detection (e.g., autonomous driving systems, early disaster detection systems, industrial IoT, smart cities) will increasingly gain importance and serve as fundamental social infrastructure.

The analogy with nervous systems can serve as an effective source of ideas for improving the autonomy, adaptability, and robustness of such foundational systems, while also providing a common ground for discussions among researchers from diverse fields.

This research aims to create a post-Shannon era communication architecture that enables feedback systems where AI, sensors, actuators, and effectors are tightly coupled. Digital Cybernetics Systems consist of a fusion of LLM-based control including Human In The Loop (HITL) and appropriate communication methods (Post-Shannon Communication). We believe this initiative represents an ambitious challenge aligned with the Grand Challenge "GC01: Innovation in Cyber Infrastructure and Architecture.".

## Our Main Hypothesis

From a communication perspective, we hypothesize that in addition to current Shannon architecture-based communication technologies, the following technological groups—which we call **Post-Shannon Communication**—are essential key enablers for realizing Digital Cybernetics Systems:

### 1. Goal-Oriented Communication
Design communication methods by linking them to specific goals and tasks for which the information will be used. In the context of digital cybernetics, we consider communication aimed at achieving task objectives while maintaining system autonomy to be effective.

### 2. Coding for Ultra-Large-Scale Communication
The number of sensors, actuators, and effectors expected in the system will be enormous. We need to theoretically clarify the performance limits of coding schemes designed for low-latency, ultra-large-scale connectivity, and develop methods that can be processed with realistic computational complexity.

### 3. Digital Homeostasis (Maintaining Constancy) and Self-Repair Functions
Exploring technologies that autonomously optimize communication methods (data rate, coding schemes) and available resources (frequency bands, system power consumption) in real-time to maintain stable operation, and developing technologies that enable rapid self-recovery from failures and disruptions are essential for improving system robustness against environmental changes.

### 4. Physics-Embedded Signal Processing
Just as nerve fiber potential evolution follows the Hodgkin-Huxley differential equations, further progress is needed in signal processing methods that explicitly incorporate governing equations of physical media carrying information, such as Maxwell's equations in wireless communication and the nonlinear Schrödinger equation in optical fiber communication.

### 5. Learning Systems Based on Dual-Process Theory (System 1, System 2)
A learning system inspired by the dual-process theory known in cognitive psychology. In AI systems, we aim to ensure adaptability to large environmental changes by transferring knowledge and learning results obtained from deliberative analytical thinking (System 2) to high-speed processing systems (System 1).

## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to establish **Post-Shannon Communication** essential for constructing Digital Cybernetics Systems with autonomy, adaptability, and robustness. We aim to achieve this goal through focused research on the technological groups mentioned above.

## Expected Social Impact and Contributions

For the healthy development of technology, it is crucial for researchers and developers to have an appropriate big picture. In this sense, the next-generation communication architecture emerging from academic exploration of Post-Shannon Communication with Digital Cybernetics in mind will itself be a significant contribution to society.

More specific potential contributions include:
1. Contributing to the realization of Digital Cybernetics Systems with autonomy, adaptability, and robustness
2. Pioneering new academic domains based on fundamental research toward Post-Shannon Communication
3. Reducing energy consumption in communication infrastructure through advanced environmental optimization
4. Realizing highly robust communication network technologies against various disturbances, natural disasters, and malicious attacks
5. Strengthening international competitiveness through the fusion of Japan's strong device technology with communication and AI technologies
6. Nurturing young communication researchers with interdisciplinary expertise

Furthermore, by developing research in directions that enhance explainability and strengthen overall system security, we expect to contribute to building robust and reliable AI social infrastructure.

## Historical Context and Future Vision

It has been exactly 80 years since Shannon's coding communication structure (Shannon Architecture) emerged. Shannon Architecture has guided the development of digital communication technology for the past 80 years. We aim to determine the shape of the next-generation communication architecture that will serve as a compass directing digital communication for the next 80 years.

## Alignment with CRONOS Objectives

This project consists of fundamental research groups aimed at transforming the structure of digital communication systems, aligning with CRONOS's goal of "creating revolutionary information and communication technologies" and the Grand Challenge "GC01: Innovation in Cyber Infrastructure and Architecture."

Furthermore, this project plans active employment of postdoctoral researchers (PD) and research assistants (RA), with the research promotion process contributing to the development of communication technology researchers with interdisciplinary strengths. Additionally, through multiple international workshop events and short-term overseas stays for young researchers, we aim to build international research networks and nurture talent in international research environments. We believe this direction also aligns with CRONOS's objectives.
