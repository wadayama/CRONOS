## Project Overview

### Project Goal
AI agents are rapidly transforming communication technology.
This research realizes "Post-Shannon Communication" supporting autonomous, adaptive, and robust large-scale AI systems.
We develop foundational technologiesâ€”goal-oriented communication, ultra-large-scale coding,
digital homeostasis, physics-aware signal processing,
and dual-process learningâ€”to create next-generation communication architecture.

## Research Themes

### 1. Goal-Oriented Communication
Design communication methods specifically tailored to concrete goals and tasks. In digital cybernetics context, we focus on achieving task objectives while maintaining system autonomy.

### 2. Ultra-Large-Scale Communication Coding
Develop coding schemes for systems with massive numbers of sensors, actuators, and effectors, focusing on low-latency and ultra-large-scale connectivity.

### 3. Digital Homeostasis
Enable real-time autonomous optimization of communication parameters (data rate, coding schemes) and available resources (frequency bands, power consumption) to maintain stable operation and rapid self-recovery from failures.

### 4. Physics-Embedded Signal Processing
Incorporate governing partial differential equations (PDEs) of physical media into signal processing:
- Maxwell's equations for wireless communication
- Nonlinear SchrÃ¶dinger equation for optical fiber communication

### 5. Dual-Process Learning System
Inspired by cognitive psychology's dual-process theory:
- **System 1**: Fast, reactive signal processing using online learning
- **System 2**: Deliberative meta-learning using LLM orchestrators
