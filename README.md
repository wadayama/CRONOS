## Latest News

- **2025/09/11** - Our project "Digital Cybernetics: Towards Next-Generation Communication Architecture" has been selected for the CRONOS program by JST (Japan Science and Technology Agency).

## Project Overview

### Project Goal
AI agents are rapidly transforming communication technology. 
This research realizes "Post-Shannon Communication" supporting autonomous, adaptive, and robust large-scale AI systems. 
We develop foundational technologies—goal-oriented communication, ultra-large-scale coding, 
digital homeostasis, physics-aware signal processing, 
and dual-process learning—to create next-generation communication architecture.


### Project Period
October 2025 - March 2031 (5.5 years)

## Research Themes

### 1. Goal-Oriented Communication
Design communication methods specifically tailored to concrete goals and tasks. In digital cybernetics context, we focus on achieving task objectives while maintaining system autonomy.

### 2. Ultra-Large-Scale Communication Coding
Develop coding schemes for systems with massive numbers of sensors, actuators, and effectors, focusing on low-latency and ultra-large-scale connectivity.

### 3. Digital Homeostasis
Enable real-time autonomous optimization of communication parameters (data rate, coding schemes) and available resources (frequency bands, power consumption) to maintain stable operation and rapid self-recovery from failures.

### 4. Physics-Embedded Signal Processing
Incorporate governing partial differential equations (PDEs) of physical media into signal processing:
- Maxwell's equations for wireless communication
- Nonlinear Schrödinger equation for optical fiber communication

### 5. Dual-Process Learning System
Inspired by cognitive psychology's dual-process theory:
- **System 1**: Fast, reactive signal processing using online learning
- **System 2**: Deliberative meta-learning using LLM orchestrators

## Key Technologies

### Post-Shannon Communication Framework
Moving beyond Shannon's 80-year-old architecture to support:
- Autonomous AI agent systems
- Adaptive and robust communication networks
- Integration with physical laws and learning systems

### Applications
- Autonomous driving systems
- Early disaster detection systems
- Industrial IoT
- Smart cities
- Digital twins with world models
