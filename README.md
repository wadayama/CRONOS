## Project Overview

### Project Goal
AI agents are rapidly transforming communication technology.
This research realizes "Post-Shannon Communication" supporting autonomous, adaptive, and robust large-scale AI systems.
We develop foundational technologiesâ€”goal-oriented communication, ultra-large-scale coding,
digital homeostasis, physics-aware signal processing,
and dual-process learningâ€”to create next-generation communication architecture.

## Research Themes

### 1. Goal-Oriented Communication
Design communication methods specifically tailored to concrete goals and tasks. In digital cybernetics context, we focus on achieving task objectives while maintaining system autonomy.

### 2. Ultra-Large-Scale Communication Coding
Develop coding schemes for systems with massive numbers of sensors, actuators, and effectors, focusing on low-latency and ultra-large-scale connectivity.

### 3. Digital Homeostasis
Enable real-time autonomous optimization of communication parameters (data rate, coding schemes) and available resources (frequency bands, power consumption) to maintain stable operation and rapid self-recovery from failures.

### 4. Physics-Embedded Signal Processing
Incorporate governing partial differential equations (PDEs) of physical media into signal processing:
- Maxwell's equations for wireless communication
- Nonlinear SchrÃ¶dinger equation for optical fiber communication

### 5. Dual-Process Learning System
Inspired by cognitive psychology's dual-process theory:
- **System 1**: Fast, reactive signal processing using online learning
- **System 2**: Deliberative meta-learning using LLM orchestrators

## Our Goal and Methodology

### Post-Shannon Communication Framework
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/guidance.png" alt="Post-Shannon Communication Framework Guidance" width="150">
</div>
It has been exactly 80 years since Shannon's coding communication structure (Shannon Architecture) emerged. Shannon Architecture has guided the development of digital communication technology for the past 80 years. We aim to determine the shape of the next-generation communication architecture that will serve as a compass directing digital communication for the next 80 years.
